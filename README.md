# 🚚 Kit Item Distribution Optimization

This project focuses on optimizing the distribution of kit items for an automotive manufacturer to ensure timely delivery, improve supplier performance, and reduce logistics and sourcing costs.

## 📌 Objective
To develop a data-driven strategy that reduces delivery delays, identifies bottlenecks, and achieves cost savings through better kit sourcing and distribution.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL (for data extraction and filtering)
- Power BI / Tableau (Data visualization)
- Excel (MIS Reports, Dashboards)

## 📈 Key Achievements
- ⏱ Reduced delivery delays by **10%**
- 💰 Achieved over **$1M cost savings**
- 🔍 Improved supplier tracking and risk analysis
